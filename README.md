# Ruby Myths

The aim of this site is to extol the virtues of the Ruby programming language and explain away some of the common concerns around its adoption or use.

Contributions are *very welcome* and so are counter-arguments. Technology choices are all about trade-offs, so inevitably some of the points on this site are going to be a little subjective. However, it's better for everyone if they're as robust as possible.


## A note about contributions

Keep it positive. I want this page to be about why Ruby is great, not why some other language isn't.
