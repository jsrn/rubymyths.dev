## "Ruby (on Rails) doesn't scale!"

[GitHub](https://github.com) is doing fine. [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) is doing fine. [Shopify](https://shopify.com) is doing fine.

[Top Ruby Companies](https://toprubycompanies.info/) indicates that, at the time of writing, the last 12 months have seen an overall revenue of $61.5 billion dollars for companies that make Ruby a key part of their stack. That seems like scale to me.
