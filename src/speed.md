## "Ruby is slow!"

First off, a concession: Yes, Ruby is slower than many languages on many benchmarks. **However.** "Slow" is a useless descriptor if you don't have a "fast enough."

Allow me to strain an analogy. If you're a driver, I'd bet that whatever car you drive isn't as fast as what they take on the F1 track. There's a good chance that you still consider your car _fast enough_. If you do have a super fast car, you might brag to your friends about how it does zero to sixty in 0.036 seconds, but 99% of the time you're never going above the posted speed limit.

At some point you start asking more relevant questions like how many cupholders it has.
