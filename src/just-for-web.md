## "Ruby is just for web development!"

You can do a heck of a lot with Ruby other than web development. Ruby is a great choice for plenty of software, like...


## Development tools

Package managers like [Homebrew](http://brew.sh). Local deployment configurations like [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) and infrastructure management tools like [Puppet](https://puppet.com/open-source/#osp) or [Chef](https://github.com/chef/chef). Hey, why don't you write something like [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) to automate huge swathes of your mobile app deployment pipeline?


## Desktop applications

[Shoes](http://shoesrb.com) helps you build GUI applications for the desktop.


## Games

You can make games in Ruby using tools like [Gosu](https://www.libgosu.org) or [DragonRuby](https://dragonruby.org), and Ruby is used as the plugin language for some versions of the popular [RPG Maker](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com) engine.


## Security testing

[Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com) modules are written in Ruby.

## More!
